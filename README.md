# Iris-Flower-Species-Predictor
I developed a Django web application that predicts iris flower species using a Random Forest Classifier trained on the iris dataset. The model, saved with Joblib, is integrated into the Django views. Users input flower measurements through a Bootstrap form, and the application displays the predicted species.
